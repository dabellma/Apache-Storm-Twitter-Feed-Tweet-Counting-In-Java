For this project, I gained access to Twitter's general tweet-student-leraning API, which allowed me to stream in tweets with Apache Storm in real time.
Once I had the tweets, I performed a lossy count algorithm to count the most popular topics. 

I set up an Apache Storm cluster with multiple nodes to distribute the counting.
